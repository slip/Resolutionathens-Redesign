    blockquote I absolutely ADORE working with Taylor for our graphic design needs. The work he produces is always exactly what we have in mind (if not even better than we imagined), and he manages to do so with sometimes very little direction from us. He pays close attention to the small details and does his research to make sure we get the best product. Taylor has been my hero more times than I can count, and I recommend him to everyone!
