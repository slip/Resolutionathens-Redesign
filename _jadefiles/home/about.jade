    | Resolution may be new but we have a history. Taylor Little founded Resolution Digital Type and Image in 1993 as Athens, Georgia's first service bureau and offered design and production. 23 years and numerous awards later, Taylor partered with Ian Kenendy and Jennifer Davidson to reimagine the company as Resolution Athens with a focus on strategy, branding, and user-centric design. In the summer of 2016, Resolution recruited Daniel Fell to round out the team.

    | That's a big, sweet promise. Resolution selectively and discerningly partners with clients we are proud to work with - the kind of companies that we sincerely want to see grow and succeed. We do everything we can to make that happen.
  p.bottom-24
    | We've worked with and for much larger firms that phoned it in, assigned projects to the B-team, and frankly cared more about their clients' wallets than their projects. We are here because we reject all of that.

    | We work iteratively with you to help you define an effective voice which resonates with your audience. The beauty of our agile design process means that you get to watch as your project takes shape. We don't go dark while you wait patiently then reappear with unapproved designs.
