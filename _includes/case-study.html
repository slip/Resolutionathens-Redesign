<section id="process-method"><h2>Case Study<br/>Sorba Atlanta</h2><hr class="faded-hr"/><figure><blockquote>Ian anticipated our needs at every stage and gave our site new features and a great design.</blockquote><figcaption>~ Brett Davidson, <em>President of SORBA Atlanta</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Discover</h3><p>Initially, Brett wanted a straight redesign. The site is essentially a blogging platform for their organization and he wanted it looking good.</p><p>As we went through the discovery phase, we <strong>identified our primary goals</strong> as unifying the look and feel of the brand across platforms, allowing <strong>easy updates through Wordpress</strong>, enhancing usability through restructuring of information, increasing awareness of the organization, generating mobile traffic by making the site <strong>responsive</strong>, boosting direct traffic, attracting repeat visitors, and <strong>generating donations</strong> and new membership.</p><h3>Concept and Design</h3><p>I began taking a close look at the sites of other Sorba chapters, trying to glean what information was most important to Sorba members. It turned out to be trail status - mountain bikers want to know if they can ride. I also wanted to draw attention to the donate button and keep the homepage fresh by featuring recent blog posts.</p><p>I provided Brett with a couple of style tiles - small, flexible documents to <strong>communicate the visual evolution of the brand</strong>.</p><div class="case-study-illustration"><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/sorba-style-tile-1.png" alt="Sorba Atlanta style tile #1."/></div><div class="case-study-illustration"><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/sorba-style-tile-2.png" alt="Sorba Atlanta style tile #2."/></div><h3>Architecture</h3><p>Once I had an idea of our design direction, I created documents for sitemap, color palette, and font choices. </p><div class="case-study-illustration"><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/sitemap.png" alt="Sorba Atlanta site map."/></div><div class="case-study-illustration"><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/colors.png" alt="Sorba Atlanta colors."/></div><h3>Wireframes</h3><p>I provided <strong>detailed wireframes</strong> for all pages of the site. I looked for <strong>approval and improvement</strong> with each step forward.</p><div class="case-study-illustration"><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/home-wireframe.png" alt="Sorba Atlanta wireframe."/></div><h3>Build</h3><p>Once I had approval on our wireframes, I gave flesh to their bones and wireframes became comps. I used the wonderful <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision app</a> to make these comps functional, allowing Brett to get a feel for the flow of the site.</p><div class="case-study-illustration"><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/home-comp.png" alt="Sorba Atlanta comp."/></div><p>Turning pretty pictures into a working website is no small task. I sat down with my favorite text editor and built a <strong>custom WordPress theme</strong> from scratch, making sure that every pixel was in its place and that my code was <strong>clean and semantic</strong>. The final site can be found <a href="http://sorba.resolutionathens.com/">here</a>.</p><div class="case-study-illustration"><img src="/assets/img/case-studies/sorba-after.jpg" alt="Sorba Atlanta after the redesign."/></div><h3>Evolve</h3><p>We are working with Brett and the board at Sorba Atlanta to provide WordPress training, including the use of the <a href="https://givewp.com/">Give donation plugin</a>. We are also providing them with a content calendar for regular updates, creating campaigns for email and social media, and setting up Google Analytics to monitor the success of our continuing efforts.</p><p>I  hope that this case study was informative if not entertaining. If you entrust your project to us, we will sweat every detail and do everything we can to earn it.</p></section><div class="color-bar"></div>
