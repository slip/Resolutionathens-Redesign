Our principals have a combined 75 years experience in branding, strategy, graphic design,
UX design, marketing, and business development. We know this stuff.</p><p class="bottom-24">As a new company we are excited to use our experience to bring a new perspective to branding and strategy: Client-centered, community sensitive, and forward-thinking.</p><div class="divider-lt bottom-24"></div></div><!--us--><h2 class="hl-us bottom-24">Us.</h2><h2 class="bottom-24">Not our first rodeo.</h2><hr class="bottom-24"/><p class="bottom-24">Resolution may be new but we have a history. Taylor Little founded Resolution Digital Type and Image in 1993 as Athens, Georgia's first service bureau and offered design and production. 23 years and numerous awards later, Taylor partered with Ian Kenendy and Jennifer Davidson to reimagine the company as Resolution Athens with a focus on strategy, branding, and user-centric design. In the summer of 2016, Resolution recruited Daniel Fell to round out the team.</p><div class="team bottom-24"><div class="teammate bottom-24"><img src="/assets/img/bio-pics/tl.png" alt="Taylor Little"/><p class="teammate-name">Taylor Little</p><p class="teammate-title">Founder</p></div><div class="teammate bottom-24"><img src="/assets/img/bio-pics/ik.png" alt="Ian Kennedy"/><p class="teammate-name">Ian Kennedy</p><p class="teammate-title">Strategy, UX</p></div><div class="teammate"><img src="/assets/img/bio-pics/jd.png" alt="Jennifer Davidson"/><p class="teammate-name">Jennifer Davidson</p><p class="teammate-title">Accounts</p></div><div class="teammate"><img src="/assets/img/bio-pics/df.png" alt="Daniel Fell"/><p class="teammate-name">Daniel Fell</p><p class="teammate-title">Creative</p></div></div><div class="divider-md bottom-24"></div><!-- you--><h2 class="hl-you bottom-24">You.</h2><h2 class="bottom-24">No one will ever love you the way we love you.</h2><hr class="bottom-24"/><p class="bottom-12">That's a big, sweet promise. Resolution selectively and discerningly partners with clients we are proud to work with - the kind of companies that we sincerely want to see grow and succeed. We do everything we can to make that happen.</p><p class="bottom-24">We've worked with and for much larger firms that phoned it in, assigned projects to the B-team, and frankly cared more about their clients' wallets than their projects.

The beauty of our agile design process means that you get to watch as your project takes shape.
